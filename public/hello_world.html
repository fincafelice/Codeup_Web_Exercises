			<!-- create a paragraph introducing yourself and telling some fun facts about yourself. Use emphasis, strong emphasis, and line break elements within the paragraph. -->
			So, that title creates a lot of expectations, right?  Well, I'm actually a very humble person, but what I hope to do in the world is to spearhead <strong>paradigm changes</strong> to the <em>current state of the world.</em><br><br>
			That might explain why my favorite quote <strong>is</strong> my favorite quote.  As Ghandi once said, <br><br>

		<h2>My Vehicle</h2>
		<p>
			So I am a muscle car affecionado, but rather girly about it.  I drive an older sports car because older cars are just built better.  It has a lambo door kit because I like the way it looks and it is more convenient when wearing high heels to easily get in and out of.  It is painted a dusty rose with a tonal effect.  Okay, the kit is in the trunk and the paint job has to wait until I install the door kit.  It's a work in progress.
